# Project Name: **Seedling**

## Project Overview: 
### App that produces random numbers from a set of physically derived data points for use as seeds for cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNG)

    <summary>About Seeds in CSPRNG:  Functionality</summary>
    User will be presented with a welcome page that allows user to upload a .csv file of a set of data composed of physical measurements that can be used as the [**initial entropy**](See: https://cryptobook.nakov.com/secure-random-generators), which are also known as **seeds**.  This initial entropy is used by a CSPRNG algorithm which expands to generate a token.  The best source of random intial entropy are true random numbers and these are usually obtained from physical measurements of a physical system.  This app will then hash the cryptographically secure random number via SHA-256 to maintain integrity.  The token, otherwise called a "seedling" in this app can be used for many functions including as secret tokens.  The goal of the app is to generate sufficiently random and cryptographically secure tokens for security applications by utilizing random physical data generated by devices or structures that produce and/or utilize zero emissions energy as seeds.  In this way this app can add value to a device because the device becomes a source for intial entropy to create cryptographically secure random numbers.  This will provide another functionality for these zero emissions devices with the potential of generating a source for real-time and continuous random data from monitors tracking the energy used and produced by the devices.

    <summary>About Datasets for Data Model</summary>
    1. App will utilize data as described above provided by the user via .csv files.  Example of target dataset type:  [Proton Exchange Membrane Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sepandhaghighi/proton-exchange-membrane-pem-fuel-cell-dataset); Additional citation for PEM dataset: S. Hamidi, S. Haghighi, K. Askari, Dataset of Standard Tests of Nafion 112 Membrane and Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) Activation Tests of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell, ChemRxiv, (2020). doi:10.26434/chemrxiv.11902023.
    2. This app will need to temporarily store a limited amount of physical datasets introduced by the user in the form of a csv file using python.  JavaScript Crypto library will be used to generate cryptographically secure random numbers and JavaScript Digest will be utilized to apply SHA-256 hashing.

    <summary>Schedule</summary>

    Tasks:

    - [ ] Create welcome page with a section to input random data as seed that will start the process of generating a hashed token.
    - [ ] Location for uploading or downloading of physically derived random measurement data.
    - [ ] Location to temporarily store user datasets as csv using Python.
    - [ ] For additional seed generation datasets can be calculated for minimums/maximum/inflection points on a graph generated by the      datasets.  This can be visualized and calculated in a seperate webpage.  The additional data points can be added to the temporary database.
    - [ ] Create empty database to temporarily store datasets.
    -[ ] Create api call for databases, CSPRNG algorithms and SHA-256 encoders.
    - [ ] Create login/logout page and backend for the user to store their seeds in their accounts.
    
    
    HTML/CSS/JavaScript will be used to prepare the webpages.  Python will be used for calculations, Dango functions and models.
